/*                                         Project Name: Number Guessing Game

    Description: We will write a program that generates a random number and asks the player to guess
    it. If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays "Lower number please" .
    Similarly, if the player's guess is too low, the program prints "Higher number please".                     */
